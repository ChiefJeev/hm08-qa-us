# Sprint 7 Project - Jeevan Gaberria
// The project in this folder contains the steps needed to run automated UI testing within the WebdriverIO framework while fulfilling a grocery order. The purpose of these tests is to test the full functionality of the Urban Grocers app and mimic a typical consumer journey through the application. There are 8 tests total to do tests through endpoints; such as adding in card/phone/address info, adding items to an order, leaving messages for our driver, and awaiting browser responses. These tests can be succesfully ran through the Visual Studio Code terminal, with the simple terminal prompt of 'npm run wdio'.
